	Abstract = {For 2D graphics or movement of 3D objects on a 2D ground plane it is often useful to discover if the 2D oriented bounding boxes of two objects overlap (have a non-empty intersection). [...] The C++ code sample provided efficiently computes this fast 2D oriented bounding box overlap. I augmented the OBB2D class with some methods for rendering and construction to help visualize the result. OBB2D::overlaps1Way performs the real work. It tests to see whether the box passed as an argument overlaps the current box along either of the current box's dimensions. Note that this test must be performed for each box on the other to determine whether there is truly any overlap. To make the tests extremely efficient, OBB2D::origin stores the projection of corner number zero onto a box's axes and the axes are stored explicitly in OBB2D::axis. The magnitude of these stored axes is the inverse of the corresponding edge length so that all overlap tests can be performed on the interval [0, 1] without normalization, and square roots are avoided throughout the entire class.},
