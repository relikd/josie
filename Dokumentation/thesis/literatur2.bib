  Abstract                 = {The growing synergy between Web Services and Grid-based technologies will potentially enable profound, dynamic interactions between scientific applications dispersed in geographic, institutional, and conceptual space. Such deep interoperability requires the simplicity, robustness, and extensibility for which SOAP was conceived, thus making it a natural lingua franca. Concomitant with these advantages, however is a degree of inefficiency that may limit the applicability of SOAP to some situations. We investigate the limitations of SOAP for high-performance scientific computing. We analyze the processing of SOAP messages, and identify the issues of each stage. We present a high-performance SOAP implementation and a schema-specific parser based on the results of our investigation. After our SOAP optimizations are implemented, the most significant bottleneck is ASCII/double conversion. Instead of handling this using extensions to SOAP we recommend a multiprotocol approach that uses SOAP to negotiate faster binary protocols between messaging participants.},

  Abstract                 = {XML and RDF are the current standards for establishing semantic interoperability on the Web, but XML addresses only document structure. RDF better facilitates interoperation because it provides a data model that can be extended to address sophisticated ontology representation techniques. We explain the role of ontologies in the architecture of the Semantic Web. We then briefly summarize key elements of XML and RDF, showing why using XML as a tool for semantic interoperability will be ineffective in the long run. We argue that a further representation and inference layer is needed on top of the Web's current layers, and to establish such a layer, we propose a general method for encoding ontology representation languages into RDF/RDF schema. We illustrate the extension method by applying it to Ontology Interchange Language, an ontology representation and inference language},

We propose two different approaches for using caches of XSLT transformed XML data in order to answer queries. The first approach checks whether or not a current query Q can be directly answered from the result of a previously answered query Qi stored in the cache. The new query is otherwise submitted to the source over the network, the answer of the query is determined, transmitted back to the client, and stored in the cache. The second approach determines only the intersection Q-Qi and integrates the result of Q--Qi into the previous results in the cache, which requires applying a numbering scheme for the output of the XSLT stylesheet. We show by experimental results that the second approach can significantly speed up the answering time in comparison to the first approach, but is not significantly slower in few worst cases than the second approach.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the biggest challenges facing businesses today is getting their diverse applications, often built on different platforms, to work together when necessary. To accomplish this, companies must implement effective application integration flexibly, quickly, and easily. Businesses initially turned to manual integration and then enterprise application integration (EAI) but subsequently have focused on service-oriented architectures. To leverage SOAs' benefits effectively, companies are beginning to use an approach known as the enterprise service bus, offered by a growing number of large and small vendors. ESB is the middleware glue that holds an SOA together and enables communication between Web-based enterprise applications. However, ESB also faces challenges, such as implementation costs and complex migration and management},

  Abstract                 = {The paper presents a Monitoring Framework for the integration layer of SOA systems realized by an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). It introduces a generic ESB Metamodel (EMM) and defines mechanisms which gather monitoring data related to the model entities. Applicability of the model is verified on the Java Business Integration (JBI) specification-available standardization of an ESB. An analysis of the JBI specification from the Metamodel perspective is presented, resulting in identification of JBI monitoring deficiencies. Then, the paper illustrates a realization of mechanisms ameliorating JBI deficiencies. The paper also defines the notion of a Monitoring Goal Metamodel which lays a foundation for a fully featured and technology-agnostic monitoring framework established on the EMM. The Monitoring Goal Metamodel allows a declarative definition of how the framework should react to anomalies by performing drill-down monitoring to diagnose the root cause of the problems. Evaluation of the prototype implementation of the ESB Monitoring Framework that verifies its correctness and fulfillment of the nonfunctional requirements is presented. Related work and some important relevant projects and technologies are also briefly described. Finally, the paper is summarized with conclusions and a vision of the proposed framework usage and extensions.},

Web services have received a lot of hype, the reasons for which are not easily determined. Some of their benefits might even seem to waste away, once we touch on the nitty-gritty details, because Web services per se do not offer a solution to underlying problems. The contributions included in this section delve into some of these issues, including: pitfalls of workflow issues; structuring procedural knowledge into problem-solving methods; discussing how a low initial entry barrier and simple technology are balanced against the long-term goal of easy integration; including semantics in a Web service modeling framework; and building on new kinds of applications such as grid enterprises.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a need to promote drastically increased levels of interoperability of product data across a broad spectrum of stakeholders, while ensuring that the semantics of product knowledge are preserved, and when necessary, translated. In order to achieve this, multiple methods have been proposed to determine semantic maps across concepts from different representations. Previous research has focused on developing different individual matching methods, i.e., ones that compute mapping based on a single matching measure. These efforts assume that some weighted combination can be used to obtain the overall maps. We analyze the problem of combination of multiple individual methods to determine requirements specific to product development and propose a solution approach called FEedback Matching Framework with Implicit Training (FEMFIT). FEMFIT provides the ability to combine the different matching approaches using ranking Support Vector Machine (ranking SVM). The method accounts for nonlinear relations between the individual matchers. It overcomes the need to explicitly train the algorithm before it is used, and further reduces the decision-making load on the domain expert by implicitly capturing the expert's decisions without requiring him to input real numbers on similarity. We apply FEMFIT to a subset of product constraints across a commercial system and the ISO standard. We observe that FEMIT demonstrates better accuracy (average correctness of the results) and stability (deviation from the average) in comparison with other existing combination methods commonly assumed to be valid in this domain.},
