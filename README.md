# Josie - A Jellyâ€™s Journey
##### A multi platform 2D side scrolling game

This project was developed during our study in Computer Science Bachelors. This was our first game development and took us around 3-4 months with 5 students. Part of our assignment was to build our own tiny physics engine and a random level generator.

*Figure 1: Random Level*

This version currently contains 3 levels (1.1 - 1.3) and a boss fight with increasing difficulty and random attack sequences. After beating the game you unlock the Random Level generator (with 3 difficulty levels). Or if you lazy you can unlock the whole content and unlimited money in the developer settings (main menu -> settings)

### Installation

1. Download the [Cocos2D engine][1]**
2. Install engine as explained in the tutorial
3. The compiled source should placed in *./JosieGame/cocos2d*
4. If you want to build the Android version you need the [Android SDK][2]
5. For the Mac or iPhone version you'll need [Xcode][3]
6. For detailed instructions refer to chapter 2.2 of [./Dokumentation/thesis/Josie_Dokumentation.pdf][4]

** just in case this download isn't available at any time in the future, there is an *old-version.7z* included. This is an older cocos2d version (in fact the version we were using during development).


### Just try the game?

Take a look in the [./bin][5] folder. The Android and Mac version should be playable right away. iOS needs to be compiled on your own machine.
